## About

This repository contains various scripts for my personal needs.
I call them agents, because I want to have them running regularly on a server.

## Usage

Generally, for all agents the `config.env.sample` file acts as a base for your custom configuration.
Copy it as `config.env` in the directory of `main.sh`, and adapt it to your needs.
